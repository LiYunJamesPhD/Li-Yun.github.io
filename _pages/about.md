Hello, my name is Li-Yun Wang (王棣雲) or James Wang. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Portland State University (PSU). Before joining the Ph.D. program at PSU, I was supervised by Dr. Liang-Hua Chen and received my master's degree from Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, in 2012. I love to work on computer vision problems such as object recognition, object detection, and image and video processing problems by leveraging image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques since I was pursuing my M.S. degree. During my Ph.D. journey, my research interest comprises Computer Vision (CV) and Multimedia Computing (MC). Specifically, I would like to utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve research problems in CV and MC. Additionally, I like to solve research problems in Computer Vision systems. Specifically, I am passionate about the following research topics:  <br/>

(1) **Adversarial Machine Learning**: In terms of this research, I focus on how effectively we can remove adversarial perturbation and enhance the robustness of the deep convolutional neural network by leveraging image processing techniques. In the future, I am happy to adopt machine learning or deep learning to resolve research problems in adversarial machine learning, <br/>
(2) **Traditional Computer Vision Problems**: these problems can be object recognization and detection, etc, <br/>
(3) **Neural Network Model Compression and Optimization**: research and develop new model compression techniques for cross-domain applications (in progress), <br/>
(4) **Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Computer vision**: Currently, I am working on multiple cool projects with an AI researcher, [Felix Nez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-nez-451b801a2/). <br/>
- Image Deblurring <br/>
- 3D Image Synthesis <br/>
(5) **Design User-Friendly Multimedia Tools for Computer Vision Applications (e.g., Object Detection and Recognization)** <br/>
