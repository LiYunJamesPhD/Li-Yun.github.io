Hello, my name is Li-Yun (James) Wang. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Portland State University (PSU). Before joining the Ph.D. program at PSU, I was supervised by Dr. Liang-Hua Chen and received my master's degree from Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, from 2010 to 2012. I passionate about computer vision problems such as object recognition, object detection, and image and video processing problems by leveraging image processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques since I was pursuing my M.S. degree. During my Ph.D. journey, my research interest includes Computer Vision (CV) and Multimedia Computing (MC). Specifically, I would like to utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve research problems in CV and MC. Specifically, I am passionate about the following research topics: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Neural Network Compression, and Optimization. I am also listing the projects I have done:  <br/>

**Research Projects**:
In-Progress Projects:
